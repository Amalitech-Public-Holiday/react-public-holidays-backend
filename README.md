# React Public Holidays Backend

## Overview

A react app backend to search for holidays in Germany, Ghana and Rwanda using a month, day, and a year.  
This project is a group project under the Amalitech training programme. The purpose is to test trainees'  
coding skills and ability to collaborate on projects effectively while helping them develop essential  
skills in working in teams especially in SCRUM settings.

## The Challenge

AmaliTech currently has 3 main branches: **Germany**, **Rwanda**, and **Ghana**.  
Collaboration on projects and other activities is sometimes a problem when meetings are scheduled on days that  
are holidays in all the countries mentioned above. React Public Holidays app will allow users to know public  
holidays in Germany, Rwanda and Ghana.

## Requirements

The team was tasked to meet the following requirements:

- Login to the system so that I can have access to the application.

- Reset my password so that I can have access to the system if I lose my password.

- Choose my country, month and day so that I can know if that day of the month is a holiday in Ghana.

- Choose "any" for either month or day so that the result is not specific to neither a day nor month  
so that I can know the all the holidays in the country or all the holidays in a particular month if provided.

- Select a single day in a month to see all the holidays for all the countries.

- Log out of the system
